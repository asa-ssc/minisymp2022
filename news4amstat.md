On Saturday, November 12, 2022, the ASA Section on Statistical Computing held a
half-day online symposium "Statistical Computing in Action".  The event
attracted 110+ participants, about half of whom were students. Held as part of the
section's membership drive, the symposium was designed to showcase the power and beauty of
statistical computing to students, help practitioners sharpen their statistical
computing skills, and foster community across different computing languages.


The symposium started with a brief background introduction of the event by the
section's 2022 chair Jun Yan. The ASA Executive Director Ron Wasserstein
delivered a welcoming remark on behalf of the ASA leadership. Ron reminded the
audience that 2022 marks the 50the anniversary of the Section on Statistical
Computing. "There are plenty of things to showcase, lots of skills that need to
be developed, and many communities and relationships that need to be fostered."
Commended by Ron, "the organizers have ambitious goals and assembled a fabulous
team of presenters for a real treat."


The symposium featured a keynote talk, a data jamboree, and a panel
discussion. Professor Emeritus Douglas Bates of University of Wisconsin-Madison
gave the keynote talk entitled "Cross-language technologies for statistics and
data science". He shared three such tools that he has used with R, Python, and
Julia and that make the transition between languages much easier:
1) the Arrow storage format, a language-neutral
format for storing and easily reading tabular data;
2) Quarto, which is a "next-generation RMarkdown" format and processor for
literate programming; and
3) the VS Code editor, which provides editing and code evaluation for all three
languages and for Jupyter notebooks.


The Data Jamboree, an invention of the symposium committee, was a party of
computing tools for solving the same data science tasks. Three presenters,
each experts in Julia, Python, and R programming, tackled the same set of research
questions about a common data set. 
The main data set was
a subset of the New York City (NYC) motor vehicle collisions data from NYC open
data. The tasks were adapted from an introduction to data science course taught
by Jun Yan at the University of Connecticut. The jamboree was skillfully chaired by Lucy
D’Agostino McGowan of Wake Forest University. The Julia workshop was led by Josh
Day of Julia Computing, the Python workshop was led by Dan Chen of University of
British Columbia, and the R workshop was led by Sam Tyner-Monroe of Tritura. All three
workshop leaders independently uncovered the same problems in the data, and each showed a unique perspective in how they approached the analysis. There was strong agreement among all three presenters on the "trust but verify" principle in data processing
and modeling.


The panel discussion on "Frontliners and Next Frontiers of Statistical Computing
in Data Science" was moderated by Kun Chen of the University of Connecticut. The
panelists were Hannah Frick of Posit; Haoda Fu of Eli Lilly; Eric Kolaczyk of
McGill University, and Teresa Sönmez of 23andMe. The panel discussed two
subjects: career development and the future of statistical computing. 
The panelists shared their
experiences as statisticians and data scientists, including their work & research, skills for career success, differences in
different career paths, diversity, equity, & inclusion, and specific suggestions for
job search and interviews. The  panelists also shared their visions for the next frontier of statistical
computing. The panelists shared their predictions and hopes for the important areas in research, available career
opportunities, and computing tools, among others, for statistical computing in
the next 5-10 years.

The event was a great success, and we are excited to continue hosting the event in the future. The symposium generated many volunteer
opportunities for our members, as well as a place for members from different computing communities to have a common conversation. Please get in touch with our section chair-elect, Mine Cetinkya-Rundel, as soon as possible if you are interested in participating and/or organizing future symposia hosted by the Section on Statistical Computing.


The organizing committee consisted of
Kun Chen of the University of Connecticut;
Linglong Kong of the University of Alberta;
Sam Tyner-Monroe of Tritura, Jun Yan of the University of Connecticut, and 
Hua Zhou of UCLA. As Program Chair-Elect and Program Chair, Chen and Kong
co-chaired the committee. The committee was supported by a steering committee
which consisted chair-elect Mine Cetinkya-Rundel of Duke University,  chair Jun
Yan of University of Connecticut, and
past chair Usha Govindarajulu of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.




Officially established in 1972, the Section of Statistical Computing has a
unique position in the era of data science. The widely accepted three-pillars of
data science are statistics, computing, and domain knowledge. Our section spans
two of them. The section's mission is to promote computational applications that
solve problems arising in statistics and data science. Through these efforts, we
advocate efficient and user-friendly computational applications arising from
methodological and software developments. In addition, we encourage the joint
application of computational statistical and data science techniques in other
fields, and act as a focal point for computational activities within the
ASA. The importance of these activities is becoming even more critical with the
advance of data technologies that challenge us with new problems.

Jamboree has been made available in public GitHub repos (see links at
