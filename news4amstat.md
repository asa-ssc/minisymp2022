On Saturday, November 12, 2022, the ASA Section on Statistical Computing held a
half-day online symposium "Statistical Computing in Action".  The event
attracted 110+ participants, about half of whom were students. As part of the
section's membership drive, it was designed to showcase the power/beauty of
statistical computing to students; help practitioners sharpen their statistical
computing skills; and foster community across different computing languages.


The symposium started with a brief background introduction of the event by the
section's 2022 chair Jun Yan. The ASA Executive Director Ron Wasserstein
delivered a welcoming remark on behalf of the ASA leadership. Ron reminded the
audience that 2022 marks the 50the anniversary of the Section on Statistical
Computing. "There are plenty of things to showcase, lots of skills that need to
be developed, and many communities and relationships that need to be fostered."
Commended by Ron, "the organizers have ambitious goals and assembled a fabulous
team of presenters for a real treat."


The symposium featured a keynote talk, a data jamboree, and a panel
discussion. Professor Emeritus Douglas Bates of University of Wisconsin-Madison
gave the keynote talk entitled "Cross-language technologies for statistics and
data science". He shared three such tools that he has used with R, Python and
Julia and that make the transition between languages much easier. The tools are
1) Arrow storage format, which can be considered as a language-neutral
format for storing and easily reading column-oriented tabular data;
2) Quarto, which is a "next-generation RMarkdown" format and processor for
literate programming; and
3) VS Code editor, which provides editing and code evaluation for all three
languages and for Jupyter notebooks.


The Data Jamboree is our invention for data science events. It is a party of
computing tools for solving the same data science tasks. The main data set is
a subset of the New York City (NYC) motor vehicle collisions data from NYC open
data. The tasks were adapted from an introduction to data science course taught
by Jun Yan at the University of Connecticut. The jamboree was chaired by Lucy
D’Agostino McGowan, Wake Forest University. The Julia workshop was led by Josh
Day of Julia Computing. The Python workshop was led by Dan Chen of University of
British Columbia. The R workshop was led by Sam Tyner of Tritura. All three
workshop leaders agreed on the "trust but verify" principle in data processing
and modeling.


The panel discussion on "Frontliners and Next Frontiers of Statistical Computing
in Data Science" was moderated by Kun Chen of the University of Connecticut. The
panelists were Hannah Frick of Posit; Haoda Fu of Eli Lilly; Eric Kolaczyk of
McGill University, and Teresa Sönmez of 23andMe. The panel discussed on two
subjects. The first was career development. The panelists shared their
experiences about their work, skills for career success, differences in
different career paths, diversity/equity/inclusion, and specific suggestions for
job search and interviews. The second subject was next frontiers of statistical
computing. The panelists shared their visions on the important areas, career
opportunities, and computing tools, among others, for statistical computing in
the next 5-10 years.


The organizing committee consisted of
Kun Chen of the University of Connecticut;
Linglong Kong of the University of Alberta;
Sam Tyner of Tritura, Jun Yan of the University of Connecticut, and 
Hua Zhou of UCLA. As Program Chair-Elect and Program Chair, Chen and Kong
co-chaired the committee. The committee was supported by a steering committee
which consisted chair-elect Mine Cetinkya-Rundel of Duke University,  chair Jun
Yan of University of Connecticut, and
past chair Usha Govindarajulu of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
We hope to continue hosting the event in the future. It generates volunteering
opportunities for our members. Please contact us know if you are interested.



Officially established in 1972, the Section of Statistical Computing has a
unique position in the era of data science. The widely accepted three-pillars of
data science are statistics, computing, and domain knowledge. Our section spans
two of them. The section's mission is to promote computational applications that
solve problems arising in statistics and data science. Through these efforts, we
advocate efficient and user-friendly computational applications arising from
methodological and software developments. In addition, we encourage the joint
application of computational statistical and data science techniques in other
fields, and act as a focal point for computational activities within the
ASA. The importance of these activities is becoming even more critical with the
advance of data technologies that challenge us with new problems.


The video recordings of the events are released in the Section's YouTube Channel

Jamboree has been made available in public GitHub repos (see links at
