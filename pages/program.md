	<summary>Cross-language technologies for statistics and data science</summary>    
	To some extent, statisticians and data scientists currently suffer from an
    "embarrassment of riches"  in that there are many high-quality, open-source
    tools written in R, Python, Julia and other languages available for our
    work.  However, having so many tools available in different languages
    creates the burden of needing to gain familiarity with many languages and
    packages - a not-inconsiderable task.  This makes finding and learning about
    cross-language technologies particularly valuable.  I will discuss three
    such tools that I have used with R, Python and Julia and that make the
    transition between languages much easier.  The first is the <a href =
    "https://arrow.apache.org">Arrow storage format</a>, which can be considered
    as a language-neutral format for storing and easily reading column-oriented
    tabular data.  (Think of it as a language-neutral binary storage format for
    data frames.) Another is <a href = "https://quarto.org">Quarto</a>, which
    can be considered as a "next-generation RMarkdown" format and processor for
    literate programming.  Those currently using knitr/RMarkdown can transition,
    more-or-less effortlessly, to Quarto and those who currently use Python or
    Julia now have an RMarkdown for their environment.  (Quarto uses <a href =
    "https://jupyter.org">Jupyter</a>, another cross-language technology, for
    evaluation of Julia and Python code blocks).  Finally the VS Code editor
    provides editing and code evaluation for the data science languages I
    mentioned, and for Jupyter notebooks, and for several other languages and
    data formats.  By gaining familiarity with these tools a data scientist can
    make the transition between analysis languages less traumatic.
