    - <details><summary>Cross-language technologies for statistics and data science</summary>

    - To some extent, statisticians and data scientists currently suffer from an "embarrassment of riches"  in that there are many high-quality, open-source  tools written in R, Python, Julia and other languages available for our work.  However, having so many tools available in different languages creates the burden of needing to gain familiarity with many languages and packages - a not-inconsiderable task.  This makes finding and learning about cross-language technologies particularly valuable.  I will discuss three such tools that I have used with R, Python and Julia and that make the transition between languages much easier.  The first is the [Arrow storage format](https://arrow.apache.org/), which can be considered as a language-neutral format for storing and easily reading column-oriented tabular data.  (Think of it as a language-neutral binary storage format for data frames.) Another is [Quarto](https://quarto.org) which can be considered as a "next-generation RMarkdown" format and processor for literate programming.  Those currently using knitr/RMarkdown can transition, more-or-less effortlessly, to Quarto and those who currently use Python or Julia now have an RMarkdown for their environment.  (Quarto uses [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org), another cross-language technology, for evaluation of Julia and Python code blocks).  Finally the VS Code editor provides editing and code evaluation for the data science languages I mentioned, and for Jupyter notebooks, and for several other languages and data formats.  By gaining familiarity with these tools a data scientist can make the transition between analysis languages less traumatic.</details>
