The normal distribution is the only distribution whose 
cumulants beyond the first two (i.e., other than the mean 
and variance) are zero. It is also the continuous distribution 
with the maximum entropy for a specified mean and variance.
Geary has shown, assuming that the mean and variance are finite, 
that the normal distribution is the only distribution where the 
mean and variance calculated from a set of independent draws are 
independent of each other.[19][20]
