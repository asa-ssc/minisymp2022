<!-- The normal distribution is the only distribution whose  -->
<!-- cumulants beyond the first two (i.e., other than the mean  -->
<!-- and variance) are zero. It is also the continuous distribution  -->
<!-- with the maximum entropy for a specified mean and variance. -->
<!-- Geary has shown, assuming that the mean and variance are finite,  -->
<!-- that the normal distribution is the only distribution where the  -->
<!-- mean and variance calculated from a set of independent draws are  -->
<!-- independent of each other. -->
